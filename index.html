		<p>
		There are many applications already on the market for staying in 
		shape, whether it's for physical exercise or for promoting mental 
		health.<br>
		Some of the apps available are even specifically targeted for users 
		in a senior age group, and doing a little research on the current market 
		and having a good notion of what's already out there can provide 
		invaluable ideas for developing our app.
		</p>
		<h2>Current Market</h2>

			A quick look at the pros and cons of 3 apps already on the market. Click tables to follow a link to a relevant site for the app.

		<h2 style="clear:both">Survey Data</h2>
		<p>
		Surveys are a great tool for collecting user data, which can help 
		identify features and influence the UI design of the app. After doing 
		market research and thinking about the problem a bit, we came up with 
		the following <a href="Survey.pdf">survey</a>. The data collected 
		from the surveys is essential to creating the user personas, journey 
		maps, etc. contained in the following sections.<br>
		For now, the following graphs illustrate the results of our surveys.
		</p>
		<image src="graphs.png">
		<h2>User Goals</h2>
		<p>
		The market research gave us a glimpse of the wealth of applications 
		existing today for the senior user. Other examples include games like 
		"Brain Fit" (designed to keep old minds active) and "Ten Percent Happier" 
		(helps seniors through isolation/stress with meditations). A common 
		point to all these apps is helping seniors with aspects of their lives 
		like their physical and mental well-being.<br>
		By analysing what these apps have to offer, as well as the surveys our team 
		sent out to seniors, we have identified some important User Goals for
		app features that could help them to stay connected, active and healthy.<br>
		A point-form summary of these goals is provided below, and we believe an app
		with all these features could have a positive impact on their lives by fostering 
		both mental and phycial well-being as well as engaging seniors socially.
		</p>
		<h3>Important User Goals:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Being able to access and play games like sudoku so that the brain is active (mental wellness).</li>
			<li>For their mental wellbeing, the user should be able to set up mediation sessions where they can relax and take a break.</li>
			<li>The user should be able to set up meetings either online or in-person to play games like chess to encourage social interactions and to keep their brain active.</li>
			<li>To stay physically fit, the user can set up daily exercises that target different areas.</li>
			<li>The user can book group training/activities with other seniors from the neighbourhood or care home like walking, running, etc to encourage interaction and physical wellness.</li>
			<li>The user can book group activities like: classes (painting classes), games (bingo), movie/gaming nights and even field trips (museum trips). </li>
			<li>The user should have a personal section where they can connect with their doctor/nurse/therapist to see what they need to do, to contact them, book appointments and even have reminders (e.g. calendar).</li>
